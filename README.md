# Price is Right

In this game, a random number is generated by the program, and the player's objective is to guess this number correctly.
The player enters their guess, and the program provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.
Based on this feedback, the player refines their guess until they correctly identify the random number.
The game continues until each player successfully guesses the number or chooses to end the game.
